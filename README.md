🏬 Store Sales Analytics Dashboard 2022 (Excel):

An interactive Excel-based business intelligence dashboard designed to analyze retail sales performance for the year 2022 across product categories, sales channels, customer demographics, and geographic regions.

📌 Purpose:

This dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly understand how the store is performing by visualizing sales trends, customer behavior, order outcomes, and channel contributions. It was built to support data-driven decision-making for marketing, inventory planning, and regional growth strategies.

🛠 Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and techniques:

* 📊 **Microsoft Excel** – Primary platform for dashboard development
* 📈 **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts** – For aggregations and visual analytics
* 🎛 **Slicers** – For dynamic filtering by category, channel, and month
* 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Preprocessing raw sales data
* 📁 **File Format** – `.xlsx` for dashboard and `.png` for preview images

📂 Data Source:

* Source: Internal / sample retail transaction dataset (2022)
* Structure includes:

  * Order details (order ID, amount, status, date)
  * Product categories (Blouse, Kurta, Saree, Western Dress, etc.)
  * Sales channels (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Meesho, Ajio, etc.)
  * Customer attributes (gender, age group)
  * Geographic data (Indian states)

The data is structured in tabular format and modeled using Excel pivot relationships.

🔍 Business Problem:
Retail businesses often struggle to consolidate large volumes of transactional data into meaningful insights.

Key questions such as:
* Which product categories drive the most revenue?
* Which platforms contribute the highest sales?
* What percentage of orders are successfully delivered?
* Which states generate the most revenue?
* Who are the primary customers by age and gender?
…are difficult to answer efficiently using raw spreadsheets.

🎯 Goal of the Dashboard:

To provide a single, interactive analytical view that:

* Tracks overall sales and order performance
* Identifies top-performing regions and channels
* Understands customer demographics
* Monitors order fulfillment quality
* Supports strategic business and marketing decisions
